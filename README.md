# Homework-4 - Jupyter, weather APIs, git and GitHub

### Qs:
1) What the assignment was about
2) Something you learned in the process
3) Something you found challenging 

### Answers:
1) This assignment was about using Jupyter for coding using APIs, creating a repository, and publishing that to GitHub.
2) I had a work-related deadline and had stayed off the program for four days. By the time I watched the recording of the lecture and did the the homework, it took some time to switch back to writing in code, and I had to reorient myself about APIs. The lesson is, to try to always keep up with class and to always practice the new skills, otherwise, it will be somewhat difficult (or time-consuming) to go back on track. 
3) I was able to hide the API key but it did not work with the URL. A TA helped but when I went back to the assignment a day after, the API key 'substitute' no longer worked. I wonder why?
